# ðŸ”¬ Predictive Modeling with `tidymodels`

This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline using the `tidymodels` ecosystem in R. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Data preprocessing with `recipes()`
- Classification model built with `parsnip()` (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
- Workflow managed via `workflows()`
- Evaluation using `yardstick()` metrics: accuracy, ROC AUC, F1, precision, recall
- Visualized results using `ggplot2`

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Case

This pipeline can be used to predict binary or multi-class outcomes such as equipment failure, customer churn, or risk classification.
