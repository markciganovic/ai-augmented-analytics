# 📊 AI-Augmented Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases a transformation from traditional analytics to modern AI-powered workflows. Each project is built with R, Shiny, GPT-4, and `tidymodels`, demonstrating how I now automate insight generation, reporting, and predictive modeling using cutting-edge tools.

## 🔁 Before AI

Before adopting AI workflows, my data analytics process relied on manual filtering, static charts, and case-by-case analysis scripts. While functional, this approach was time-intensive, inconsistent, and hard to scale or reuse.

## 🚀 After AI: Projects That Reflect My Upgrade

### 🧿 `dashboard/`
An interactive Shiny dashboard for monitoring KPIs with dynamic filters, time-series visualizations, and searchable data tables.

### 🔴 `gpt-reporting/`
An AI-powered reporting system that uses layered GPT-4 prompts to analyze structured datasets and auto-generate Excel narratives.

### 🟩 `ml-modeling/`
A predictive modeling pipeline using the `tidymodels` framework, including stratified sampling, preprocessing, classification (Random Forest & Logistic Regression), and Excel export of performance metrics.

Each project reflects:  
✅ Real-world business framing  
✅ Clean, reproducible pipelines  
✅ Integration of automation, machine learning, and AI insight generation
